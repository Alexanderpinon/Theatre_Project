## Introduction

For the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked with my peers in a team developing a full scale MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#.It was a great learning oppertunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features.  I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. I worked on several back end stories that I am very proud of. Because much of the site had already been built, there were also a good deal of front end stories and UX improvements that needed to be completed, all of varying degrees of difficulty. Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories. Over the two week sprint I also had the opportunity to work on some other project management and team programming skills that I'm confident I will use again and again on future projects.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets.

## Back-End Stories 

- Photo Storage/Retrieval

# Photo Storage/Retrieval

This page had a way to add a cast member along with a photo of them and upload it directly from their local system. I achived this by first making a binary reader in the controller so it could convert to byte then in the view i had to make a way so it converts back to a picture and shows on the index page.

## Front-End Stories


- Styling of crud pages

- Contact page

# Styling of crud pages 

This website had to follow a styling of very specific color pallette and the use of buttons so it flows together very neatly. Every page of the website had to be insync with the styling. We all had to work together as a team to make sure we're all adding similar styling.

# Contact page 

This website has a Contact page that i personally had the opportunity to build from the ground up. using the same color pallette but i was able to add my own styling to it so it looked welcoming for users.
